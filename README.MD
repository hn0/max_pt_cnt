# THE ISSUE

Goal is to create an algorithm capable of optimizing for maximum number of points from given 2d space under constraint of exceeding the minimum euclid distance between any two given points.

	Input:  ordered csv file containing points in 4326 reference system
	Output: ordered list of selected points
